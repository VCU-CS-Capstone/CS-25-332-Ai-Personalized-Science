# CS-25-332 AI Personalized New Science

# Project Description
Rapid expansion of new knowledge makes it impossible for engineers or scientists to keep up to date with everything that is posted or published in their field of expertise. The project is focused on designing an AI solution based on Large Language Models that would scan and understand new literature in the background, in a way that is more in-depth than keyword-based or history-based recommendation systems, and alert the user about new information only if it is highly relevant to their interests. The project has the potential to improve skill retention among highly-trained experts.

## Short Project Description
This project has potential to kepe engineers and scientists up to date on their area of expertise. This is done by using AI and LLM's to organize and deliver personalized science to users that is more in-depth than manual searching and recommendations.

The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project. 

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| Documentation |  all documentation the project team has created to describe the architecture, design, installation, and configuration of the project |
| Notes and Research | Relevant helpful information to understand the tools and techniques used in the project |
| Project Deliverables | Folder that contains final pdf versions of all Fall and Spring Major Deliverables |
| Status Reports | Project management documentation - weekly reports, milestones, etc. |
| scr | Source code - create as many subdirectories as needed |
